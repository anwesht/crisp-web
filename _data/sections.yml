-   title: CRISP Type 2&#x3a; Integrative Decision Making Framework to Enhance the Resiliency of Interdependent Critical Infrastructures
    id: crisp
    content: The reliable functioning of infrastructures is critical to national security and fundamental to social,
      economic, and environmental well-being. Cascading failures due to the interdependencies among different critical
      infrastructures (CIs) demonstrate the need to understand the interdependency and resiliency of the CIs.
      This CRISP research aims to understand the effects of physical-based (primarily co-location), virtual-based
      (primarily information), and socioeconomic-based (primarily resource management) interdependencies on the
      resiliency of critical infrastructures, focusing on water, transportation and cyber infrastructures, and to
      develop an integrative decision making framework to evaluate and enhance the resiliency of interdependent
      critical infrastructures under different scenarios.
