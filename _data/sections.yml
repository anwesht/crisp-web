-   title: Task 1 &#x3a; Physical-based Interdependency – Water-transportation Modeling
    id: t1
    content: <ul>
      <li class="light"> &#9658; <b> Objective </b> &#x3a; Investigate the impact of physical-based interdependencies
        (primarily common rights-of-way) using a multi-layer network modeling approach </li>
      <li class="light"> &#9658; <b> Progress </b> &#x3a; Three activities are being conducted under this task. </li>
      </ul>


-   title: Task 2 &#x3a; Virtual Interdependency – Transportation-cyber Modeling
    id: t2
    content: <ul>
      <li class="light"> &#9658; <b> Objective </b> &#x3a; Investigate the impact of virtual-based dependencies on the
        operational resiliency using transportation and cyber as infrastructure examples (such as cyber attack on TMC
        center, signals or detectors, or cyber failure caused by natural disaster, cyber attack, out of power) </li>
      <li class="light"> &#9658; <b> Progress </b> &#x3a; The activity with a focus of problem formulation on system
      resilience optimization is being conducted under this task. </li>
      </ul>

    id: t3
    content: <ul>
      <li class="light"> &#9658; <b> Objective </b> &#x3a; Propose an innovative prognostic and health management (PHM)
        framework to maintain and improve the resiliency of critical infrastructures</li>
      <li class="light"> &#9658; <b> Progress </b> &#x3a; Two activities with one focusing on proactive maintenance
        and one on restoration planning are being conducted under this task.
      </li>
      </ul>

-   title: Task 4 &#x3a; Parameters of Organizational Resiliency
    id: t4
    content: <ul>
      <li class="light"> &#9658; <b> Objective </b> &#x3a; Identify influential factors in managing CIs and the
        strategies creating consensus among high-level stakeholders63. We will also apply conceptual validation for the
        descriptive variables. </li>
      <li class="light"> &#9658; <b> Progress </b> &#x3a; Stakeholder interviews and analysis are being conducted
        under this task.  </li>
      </ul>

-   title: Task 5 &#x3a; Multi-method Adaptive Simulator
    id: t5
    content: <ul>
      <li class="light"> &#9658; <b> Objective </b> &#x3a; Develop a multi-paradigm adaptive simulator, including
        system dynamics that models socioeconomic systems via a top-down approach, and agent-based models that model a
        network of stakeholders associated with the decision making and management process of CIs via a bottom-up
        approach. </li>
      <li class="light"> &#9658; <b> Progress </b> &#x3a;  The prototype agent-based simulation engine was designed
        for the interdependent water-transportation infrastructures in the City of Tampa. Cascading algorithm and
        decision-making behaviors for maintenance crew were designed and implanted in Java and AnyLogic software.</li>
      </ul>

    content: <ul>
      <li class="light"> &#9658; <b> Objective </b> &#x3a; Design a simulation game platform such that different teams
        from academia and practitioners can evaluate their developed strategies through a feedback learning
        environment</li>
      </ul>
