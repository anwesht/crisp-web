    id: about
    content: The goal of the proposed research is to develop an integrative decision making framework with consideration
     of physical-based, virtual-based, and socioeconomic-based interdependencies between water, transportation and
     cyber infrastructures for evaluating strategies to enhance the resiliency of interdependent critical infrastructures.

-   title: Task 1
    id: t1
    content: Task 1 employs water and transportation infrastructures to examine the impact of physical-based interdependencies on the operational resiliency of the infrastructures.


-   title: Task 2
    id: t2
    content: Task 2 uses transportation and cyber infrastructures to investigate the impact of virtual-based interdependencies.

-   title: Task 3
    id: t3
    content: Task 3 integrates all three infrastructures based on Tasks 1 and 2 and adds another type of interdependency,
      socioeconomic-based interdependency, to examine the operational strategies of the infrastructures.

-   title: Task 4
    id: t4
    content: Task 4 identifies influential factors in managing CIs and provides feedbacks for Tasks 1-3 in terms of
      design and operational strategies.

-   title: Task 5
    id: t5
    content: Design and operational strategies (Tasks 1-3) and socioeconomic factors (Task 4) will feed into Task 5 for
      the development of a multi-method adaptive simulator with strategic consideration of organizational theories.

-   title: Task 6
    id: t6
    content: The simulator from task 5 will be used as the foundation for the competition-based learning game
