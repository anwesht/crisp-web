                    The purpose of water infrastructure simulation is to evaluate the resilience of the current City of Tampa water distribution infrastructure and to assess the interdependency between it and other infrastructure systems (e.g. transportation, cyber, socio-economic impacts). The water distribution network model is used within the open source hydraulic modeling software, EPANET, to conduct simulations and analyses as described in the following. Extended period simulation of each individual water distribution component failure has been completed for the City of Tampa network, including both junctions and pipes. In conjunction with failure thresholds, the simulation results were also used to construct a logical consequence network, to represent relationships of hydraulic influence between different components within the water distribution network. The logical consequence network allows identification of critical and vulnerable components, which is a key to enhancing resilience. Network based topological analyses were conducted for both the physical-spatial water distribution network and the logical consequence network. In addition, a combination of simulation and network based approaches has been explored.

                <p class="text-justify light">
                    Tampa Bay Regional Planning Model (TBRPM) version 8.2 and CUBE Voyager package as simulation software programs are used to simulate the traffic performance influenced by transportation infrastructure. To reduce the time of simulation, a subarea model involving only the City of Tampa transportation network has been developed. This subarea model consists of CUBE packages for ‘highway assignment’ program which assigns origin-destination traffic volume to different routes. The ultimate goals of the simulation are to identify the most critical links in the network based on several performance measures and determine the impacts if one or more of these critical links become dysfunctional. This process includes removing (100% capacity reduction) one link from the network, letting the model reassign the traffic volume on that link to other available routes, and then determining the effect of this reassignment based on three different performance measures. The performance measures being considered are, summation of link travel times of all links, summation of link flow multiplied by link travel time for all links and summation of volume to capacity ratio (v/c) for links with v/c greater than one. The decision to choose these measures for the subarea model to evaluate the network has been taken based on the results from previously mentioned District 7 simulation.

                <p class="text-justify light">
                    Performance measures and failure thresholds have been adopted for both water and transportation infrastructures. The adopted measure and thresholds will be used to quantify vulnerability and resilience to account for physical/co-location interdependencies. An interface network was created for the City of Tampa by: overlaying both water distribution and transportation roads, accounting for road lane width, and extracting their intersection within ArcGIS. The interface network topology was analyzed from a network analysis perspective as a directed network, while it also served as a logical network representing failure propagation from the water distribution network to the transportation roads. Using the logical consequence networks from water and transportation, a mathematical model for identification of critical water distribution components while accounting for interdependency with the transportation road network was created. A multi-objective optimization approach was used to solve the problem. Results from solving the multi-objective optimization problem were the critical components and were then integrated into the ArcGIS environment for further geo-spatial analyses, making the model results useful for utilities.

                    This activity focuses on the formulation of optimization problem to involve transportation system resilience measures, alternative countermeasures and proper constrains. A resilience measure involving travel time and unmet demand in a transportation system is proposed as the objective function to solve the problem for the infrastructure restoration planning after disruptive events. To integrate the quantification of resilience measures with restoration decision-making, a bi-level optimization model is proposed. The upper- and lower-level problems were solved by a modified active set algorithm and a network representation method derived from Network Design Problems, respectively. Furthermore, a simulation based optimization framework was proposed for traffic signal restoration sequence optimization after signal failure. Two resilience measures, the accumulated total delay and the maximum total delay during restoration are proposed to quantify the system performance resulting from different signal restoration strategies. System performance evaluation under different restoration strategies are evaluated through traffic simulation in Vissim.                         </p>

                    This activity focused on prognostic health management framework for deteriorating infrastructures. A mathematical framework for real-time prognostic health management of the deteriorating physical infrastructure (e.g., transportation/water infrastructure) was developed to utilize the field monitoring/inspection data in improving the failure prediction of physical infrastructure. Both novel Bayesian model and computational algorithm have been developed to analyze the bi-level heterogeneous degradation data and realize both off-line model learning of multiple deteriorating infrastructure components (e.g., roads, pipes) and on-line sequential updating of an individual deteriorating component. Both the numerical case study and real case study were further performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodological framework.
