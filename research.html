                    The purpose of water infrastructure simulation is to evaluate the resilience of the current
                    City of Tampa water distribution infrastructure and to assess the interdependency between it
                    and other infrastructure systems (e.g. transportation, cyber, socio-economic impacts). The water
                    distribution network model is used within the open source hydraulic modeling software, EPANET,
                    to conduct simulations and analyses as described in the following. Extended period simulation
                    of each individual water distribution component failure has been completed for the City of Tampa
                    network, including both junctions and pipes. In conjunction with failure thresholds, the simulation
                    results were also used to construct a logical consequence network, to represent relationships of
                    hydraulic influence between different components within the water distribution network. The logical
                    consequence network allows identification of critical and vulnerable components, which is a key to
                    enhancing resilience. Network based topological analyses were conducted for both the
                    physical-spatial water distribution network and the logical consequence network. In addition,
                    a combination of simulation and network based approaches has been explored.

                <p class="text-justify light">
                    Tampa Bay Regional Planning Model (TBRPM) version 8.2 and CUBE Voyager package as simulation
                    software programs are used to simulate the traffic performance influenced by transportation
                    infrastructure. To reduce the time of simulation, a subarea model involving only the City of Tampa
                    transportation network has been developed. This subarea model consists of CUBE packages for
                    ‘highway assignment’ program which assigns origin-destination traffic volume to different routes.
                    The ultimate goals of the simulation are to identify the most critical links in the network based
                    on several performance measures and determine the impacts if one or more of these critical links
                    become dysfunctional. This process includes removing (100% capacity reduction) one link from the
                    network, letting the model reassign the traffic volume on that link to other available routes,
                    and then determining the effect of this reassignment based on three different performance measures.
                    The performance measures being considered are, summation of link travel times of all links,
                    summation of link flow multiplied by link travel time for all links and summation of volume
                    to capacity ratio (v/c) for links with v/c greater than one. The decision to choose these measures
                    for the subarea model to evaluate the network has been taken based on the results from previously
                    mentioned District 7 simulation.

                <p class="text-justify light">
                    Performance measures and failure thresholds have been adopted for both water and transportation
                    infrastructures. The adopted measure and thresholds will be used to quantify vulnerability and
                    resilience to account for physical/co-location interdependencies. An interface network was created
                    for the City of Tampa by: overlaying both water distribution and transportation roads, accounting
                    for road lane width, and extracting their intersection within ArcGIS. The interface network topology
                    was analyzed from a network analysis perspective as a directed network, while it also served as a
                    logical network representing failure propagation from the water distribution network to the
                    transportation roads. Using the logical consequence networks from water and transportation,
                    a mathematical model for identification of critical water distribution components while accounting
                    for interdependency with the transportation road network was created. A multi-objective optimization
                    approach was used to solve the problem. Results from solving the multi-objective optimization
                    problem were the critical components and were then integrated into the ArcGIS environment for
                    further geo-spatial analyses, making the model results useful for utilities.

                        system resilience measures, alternative countermeasures and proper constrains. A resilience
                        measure involving travel time and unmet demand in a transportation system is proposed as the
                        objective function to solve the problem for the infrastructure restoration planning after
                        disruptive events. To integrate the quantification of resilience measures with restoration
                        decision-making, a bi-level optimization model is proposed. The upper- and lower-level
                        problems were solved by a modified active set algorithm and a network representation method
                        derived from Network Design Problems, respectively. Furthermore, a simulation based optimization
                        framework was proposed for traffic signal restoration sequence optimization after signal
                        failure. Two resilience measures, the accumulated total delay and the maximum total delay
                        during restoration are proposed to quantify the system performance resulting from different
                        signal restoration strategies. System performance evaluation under different restoration
                        strategies are evaluated through traffic simulation in Vissim.
